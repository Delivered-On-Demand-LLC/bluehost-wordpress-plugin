### JavaScript Frontend Atomic Design

* Atoms
* Molecules
* Organisms
* Templates
* Pages

#### Atoms

Atoms are reusable, portable and cannot be further reduced without ceasing to be functional.

Atoms often contain one or a few HTML elements (a label and input to create a field).

Examples:
* Paragraph
* Heading
* Input field
* Image
* Button
* Box
* Column

#### Molecules

Molecules are composable, reusable patterns that contain multiple HTML elements or Atoms.

Molecules can contain Atoms and DOM elements, not other Molecules.

Examples:
* Search field (with Input and Button atoms).
* Button Group
* Cards
* List sections

#### Organisms

Organisms are discrete parts of an interface that may contain multiple molecules, atoms and HTML elements.

Organisms can contain Atoms, Molecules and sometimes smaller organisms.

Examples:
* Headers
* Navigation
* Sidebars
* Setting Groups
* BWAProductGrids
* Footers

#### Templates

Templates are reusable layouts across Pages, containing Organisms, Molecules, Atoms and DOM Elements.

Templates can extend other Templates. In our SPA, we have a Standard template, a Common template and a Marketplace template.

Examples:
* Standard
* MarketplaceBWAProductGrid
* MarketplaceItem

#### Pages

Pages implement a Template and contain unique, unrepeatable combinations of Organisms, Molecules, Atoms and information.
